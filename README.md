Algorithm implementation learned from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-java-aes-encryption-and-decryption/

Use:
To start encryption, plain text can be read from the unencrypted file "testFile.txt"
From here it is encrypted, the key is printed to the console, and the encrypted file contents are written to "ciphertext.txt".

To start decryption the name of the file to be decrypted is entered (in this case, "ciphertext.txt", the user is prompted for the encryption key,
then the file contents are decrypted and written to "plaintext.txt"
